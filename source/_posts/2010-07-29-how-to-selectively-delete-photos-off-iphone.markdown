To spread some knowledge I found really helpful, [this thread](http://discussions.info.apple.com/message.jspa?messageID=7569336#7569336) contains the answer to the question.  The iPhoto app will let you delete all downloaded images, but I wanted to delete a select range (some big videos in particular).  The short version: quit iPhoto, launch Image Capture, click _Download Some..._, select photos to delete, and delete from the edit menu.  Done.  Thanks FloBro!
