I made about a gallon of homemade ginger beer.  It's not perfect but it's pretty damn good - if you like it spicy.

I was flicking through the Southwest Air in-flight magazine the other week and they had some cocktail recipes, so I shoved the mag in my backpack and forgot about it until last weekend, when I made a batch.  I just tasted the first glass, and it's hot as hell but pretty good.  It's gingery, lightly carbonated, not too sweet, and tastes a little too much of habanero.  I'll make it again but modify the recipe a little.   Here's what I'll do next time:



	
  * _Juice from 1lb finely grated ginger_

	
  * _Juice from 8 small lemons_

	
  * _18 oz turbinado sugar (a light brown fairly unrefined sugar)_

	
  * _80 oz water_

	
  * _2-4 habanero chillies, halved and deseeded_

	
  * _Champagne yeast_


_Bring some of the water to boil and dissolve sugar.  Add the juice from the grated ginger, lemon juice, remainder of water and habaneros.  Stick it in the fridge overnight._

_Remove habaneros, bring back to room temperature (I did it on the stove), bottle and add a little yeast to each bottle (I used 32 oz gatorade bottles, and about 1/8 teaspoon yeast per bottle).  Cap tightly, shake really really well, and keep in a warm place for a day or two until the pressure in the bottle has built.  Refrigerate to stop further fermentation._

Lessons learned from this try:



	
  * Add yeast directly into bottles.  Despite stirring and ladling I was left with the majority of yeast I pitched into the pan of ginger beer at the bottom of the pan, not in the bottles.  And they didn't carbonate first time round.

	
  * Less habaneros - not that the hot and spicy is bad, but it tastes like chilli ginger beer.

	
  * Grating ginger continues to be a threat to the structural integrity of my fingertips, but squeezing the juice out of ungrated ginger is really difficult and in the long run probably more painful.


Next steps: handful of ice, twist of lemon, splash or two of ginger beer, and a slug of Woodford Reserve...
